Prog.name: JSON Parser

1:   I have tokenised(using a structure that contains the token 	type, its starting, ending positions and its size with 	respect to the characters in the file) the JSON data and 	have done parsing(checking for the proper format of each 	token ) and printing an appropriate error message if a 	mistake is found with respect to delimiters and adherence 	to the format of JSON data. The name of this program is 	'read'.

	The program displays various tokens, their types, their 	sizes etc. It also displays the  frequency of each token 	type.

	Input must be a file containig JSON data.

2:   I have also made a program that asks for the data from the 	user and puts it in appropriate JSON fromat using tokens 	available.
	
	The output is available in a file, hte name of which can 	be chosen by the user, at the end of the program. The name 	of this program is 'jsonmake'.
